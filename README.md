# EYE_20_20_20

As we work on computers every day, we often forget to follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look away from your screen at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. It's easy to lose track of time when you're engrossed in your work. This is where Eye 20 20 20 comes in. It reminds you to take a break every 20 minutes and prompts you to get back to work after 20 seconds. Happy Eyes!
Feel free to give your sugestions on the code!
